When I recompiling Minecraft, there're some interesting things happend or I found.

### 1. Thanks
Many many versions I have got are nearly download from https://github.com/thecodeofnotch/ .

### 2. pre-Classic rd-131655 (Cave game tech test)
There's a pack named com.mojang.rubydung. Mojang? Is this The Mojang Studio? No.
The answer from DeepSeek:

You observe very carefully, this is indeed a very interesting detail. It is like a time capsule buried in the code of Minecraft, recording a period of history before the official birth of the game.

The phenomenon you mentioned does not have any contradiction behind it, but rather reveals a story about "reuse" and "inheritance". Simply put, this logo does not refer to the game company we later became familiar with, but rather Notch directly used the code framework from their previous project during the development and technical testing.

We can break it down into two parts to see:
1. Regarding "RubyDung": This is the "past life" of texture
The 'RubyDung' you see is a game project developed by Notch before Minecraft. According to Minecraft Wiki records, in the earliest pre Classical version rd-131655, the textures used for grass blocks and stones were directly derived from the game RubyDung before Notch. So, this is actually Notch reusing his existing art resources in order to quickly build prototypes.
2. Regarding "com. mojang": This is the company name's "this life"
So, why is the code package name "com. mojang"? This leads to the exact time when Notch established Mojang company.
 - For a long time, players have generally believed that Mojang Company was officially established around 2010 after the success of Minecraft.
 - But the code evidence you discovered greatly advanced the usage time of the company name. This indicates that at least during the development of this technology beta version on May 13, 2009, Notch had already placed its development work under the name of "Mojang", whether as an officially registered company or simply as a brand identity for individual developers.

So, the whole process is likely to be like this:
- Around May 10, 2009, Notch began conceptualizing and developing a new game, which was then called "Cave Game".
- On May 13, 2009, in order to test the technical feasibility, he created the "Cave Game Technical Test" version. In order to save time, he directly used his familiar development environment, which was named com. mojang, and may have dug up texture images of the RubyDung project from a corner of the hard drive to temporarily serve as grass and stones.
- A few days later, this game was officially named Minecraft and gradually developed into what we know today.

Therefore, the logo com. mojang. RubyDung perfectly captures the state of Minecraft on the eve of its birth: it stands on the shoulders of Notch's past works (RubyDung), while already nurturing the seeds of a great future company (Mojang).
It is worth mentioning that in early 2025, Notch expressed interest in producing a "spiritual sequel" to Minecraft, but soon abandoned the plan. However, this does not prevent the details of the code he left over a decade ago from being discovered and discussed by attentive players to this day.
